**Imagery**

All images are representative of the items in the products section.

**Interactive links**

The site includes internal hyperlinks to the different pages of the site and external hyperlinks to Facebook, Twitter and Instagram, which open in a new browser tab.

The contact page includes an email address hyperlink that will automatically open a user's email application and autofill the email address in the "To" field, the subject 'Mail from our site' in the "Subject" field, and the text 'Thank you for contacting us. Please let us know how we can help you...' in the body.

**Wireframes**

Wireframes for desktop and mobile views were created using [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/wireframes/ "Balsamiq").

[View the desktop and mobile wireframes here](docs/wireframes/ "Wireframes")

Wireframes were created for desktop and mobile views only. It was considered that this would be sufficient to inform the layout of the tablet view.

Similarly, wireframes were created for the homepage, recipes page, and full recipe page only. It was considered that this would be sufficient to inform the design of other pages.

**Database scheme**

ElephantSQL manages the data for the various applications
