**Imagery**

All images are representative of the items in the products section.

**Interactive links**

The site includes internal hyperlinks to the different pages of the site and external hyperlinks to Facebook, Twitter and Instagram, which open in a new browser tab.

The contact page includes an email address hyperlink that will automatically open a user's email application and autofill the email address in the "To" field, the subject 'Mail from our site' in the "Subject" field, and the text 'Thank you for contacting us. Please let us know how we can help you...' in the body.

**Wireframes**

Wireframes for desktop and mobile views were created using [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/wireframes/ "Balsamiq").

[View the desktop and mobile wireframes here](docs/wireframes/ "Wireframes")

Wireframes were created for desktop and mobile views only. It was considered that this would be sufficient to inform the layout of the tablet view.

Similarly, wireframes were created for the homepage, recipes page, and full recipe page only. It was considered that this would be sufficient to inform the design of other pages.

**Database scheme**

The site uses a relationship database. ElephantSQL manages the SQL data for the various applications.

## 5. Testing

**W3C markup validator**

The [W3C Markup Validator](https://validator.w3.org/ "W3C Markup Validator") was used to to validate the site's HTML.

Copies of the reports for each page can be accessed [here](/ci_msp4/docs/tests/html_validator/ "W3C Markup Validator report").

**W3C CSS validator**

The [W3C CSS Validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/ "W3C CSS Validator") was used to validate the site's CSS. Warnings related to Bootstrap CSS, vendor extensions, vendor extended pseudo-elements, and vendor extended pseudo-classes were ignored.

Copies of the reports for each page can be accessed [here](/ci_msp4/docs/tests/css_validator/ "W3C CSS Validator reports").

**Lighthouse testing**

The website was tested using Lighthouse on the Chrome and Microsoft Edge browsers to determine the websiteâ€™s performance, accessibility, best practices, and SEO.

For desktop and mobile, on both Chrome and Edge, accessibility, best practice, and SEO scored at least 90%.

For desktop and mobile, on both Chrome and Edge, performance scored less than 90% (with the exception of Edge mobile, which scored at least 90%). This was considered acceptable at this time; however, the developer may look to improve this in the future.

The reports can be viewed below:

- [Chrome Desktop](/ci_msp4/docs/tests/chrome-lighthouse-desktop-1.pdf "Chrome Desktop report")

- [Chrome Mobile](/ci_msp4/docs/tests/chrome-lighthouse-mobile-1.pdf "Chrome Mobile report")

- [Edge Desktop](/ci_msp4/docs/tests/edge-lighthouse-desktop-1.pdf "Edge Desktop report")

- [Edge Mobile](/ci_msp4/docs/tests/edge-lighthouse-mobile-1.pdf "Edge Mobile report")

The [ally Color Contrast Accessibility Validator](https://color.a11y.com/Contrast/ "ally Color Contrast Accessibility Validator") was used to test for color contrast problems. The Validator retuend 1 problem with contrast color-pairs. This problem was resolved by adjusting the contrast of the font color.

A copy of the original report can be accessed [here](/ci_msp4/docs/tests/a11y-contrast-accessibility-validator-1.pdf "ally Color Contrast Accessibility Validator report").

A copy of the final report can be accessed [here](/ci_msp4/docs/tests/a11y-contrast-accessibility-validator-2.pdf "ally Color Contrast Accessibility Validator report").

**Responsiveness testing**

The website's responsiveness was tested manually, using the Google Chrome DevTools, and the [Responsive Design Cheker](https://responsivedesignchecker.com/ "Responsive Design Checker") website.

The website was responsive on all screen sizes from 320x480px to 1920x1200px.
