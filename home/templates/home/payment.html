            <h6>Payment Types</h6>
            <p>We are happy for you to pay for the items you purchase in the way that suits you the best. You can use
                all
                the following payment types:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Visa Debit / Credit</li>
                <li>Visa Electron</li>
                <li>Mastercard</li>
                <li>Maestro International</li>
            </ul>
            <h6>When will I be charged for my order?</h6>
            <p>If you use a credit or debit card you will usually see we authorise the payment to make sure that the
                details are correct and the necessary funds are available when you place an order, however you will not
                actually be charged until the item has been dispatched. If for any reason your order is cancelled the
                authorisation payment may take up to 3 working days to be released. You may see that the money is gone
                from
                your account before the item has been dispatched, however please be aware that this is because the bank
                has
                set the funds aside for the payment and is holding the money in a virtual bank hold.</p>
            <p>If for any reason you cancel the order before it has been shipped or you return the item after receipt we
                will refund the money to you immediately, however it may take a few days to show in your account.</p>
