Like all of KitchenCraft's Living Nostalgia creations, this tin is inspired by the functional forms and vintage character of times gone by. The soft colours complement traditional and modern kitchens, giving an understated look that blends in with any setting. As a final decorative touch, the container is printed with the word 'BISCUITS'. So whether you've baked a fresh batch of cookies at home, or you've treated yourself to a pack of custard creams, you'll always know where to look for the next sugary snack. Measures 14.5 x 19 cm (6 in x 7.5 inches). Hand-wash only. This tin is made of robust steel, for a lightweight yet durable construction - just like biscuit tins used to be. It has the same tall design as KitchenCraft's other popular Living Nostalgia storage canisters. Its square footprint maximises space on the kitchen worktop, and it can sit neatly on a shelf with other storage tins too. The biscuit tin has a tight-fitting lid, which keeps your biscuits crisp and delicious for longer (if you can resist eating them!). Though the lid fits snugly on top of the tin, you won't need to break any nails to get it open. The easy-open handle means you only need to give a gentle tug to pop the lid off.",

Their classic look is inspired by vintage kitchens, while their robust design harks back to a time of peerless craftsmanship. This set of scales features an old-fashioned dial, powered by a finely tuned mechanical mechanism. It's designed to be easy to read, and displays weights in imperial (lbs) and metric (kg) units, so it's easy to follow those classic recipes from vintage cookbooks. The dial is divided into increments of 20 grammes and one ounce for highly accurate measuring. More Information: Scales measure 30 x 25 cm (12 x 10 inches). Bowl is dishwasher safe. Scales are wipe-clean only. Features adjustment dial to calibrate mechanism. These mechanical kitchen scales are great for measuring out all manner of ingredients - from fruits to flour, butter to icing sugar. They feature an extra-large bowl made of high-quality stainless steel with a lovely mirror polished finish. The wide design means you can measure up to 4 kgs / 8.5 lbs in one go, and because it's stainless steel, it won't pick up flavours or odours. You can also flip the bowl and place it over the top of the scales for easy storage. Vintage kitchenware wasn't just useful - it was beautiful. KitchenCraft's Living Nostalgia collection takes cues from the rustic kitchens of the past, resulting in a range of convenient kitchen and household products that's equal parts pretty and practical.",
